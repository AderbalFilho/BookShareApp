# BookShareApp
A book manager app. With it, you can manage the books that you have, your friends (that as you, love to read) and your loans for them.
In future, we wanted to implement a search system at public Toronto libraries (we found a public json link), to easily find the book that you need, but, as you probably have faced this before, we didn't have time.

It's an **Android Java project**, that I've done with @johnattandouglas for MAP524 Seneca Course.

**We had some issues to put the project at github, so I'm not sure if it's working here, but as we get an A, it was good in my computer and phone, :laughing:**
